% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g. \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex,10pt,a4paper]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

%DIF < 	The vertical attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance (\ked{}) is an apparent optical property commonly used in primary production models to propagate incident solar radiation in the water column. Measuring \ked{} is relatively trivial in open waters. In ice-covered waters, however, the spatially heterogeneous incident light field resulting from sea ice and related features (ridges, snow, melt ponds, leads) makes its determination challenging. For instance, one typical feature in irradiance profiles under heterogeneous sea ice is a subsurface light maximum between $\approx$ 5-20 meters depth. Using both in-situ data and 3D Monte-Carlo numerical simulations, we show that: (1) the large-area average downward irradiance profile (\meanedz) underwater light profile under heterogeneous sea ice cover can nevertheless be represented by a single-term exponential function and: (2) the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance (\klu{}), which is up to two times less influenced by an heterogeneous incident light field than \ked{} in the vicinity of a melt pond, can be used to parameterize the \meanedz{} profile.

\abstract{The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance (\ked{}) is an apparent optical property commonly used in primary production models to propagate incident solar radiation in the water column. In open water, estimating \ked{} is relatively straightforward when a vertical profile of measurements of downward irradiance, \ed{}, is available. In the Arctic, the ice pack is characterized by a complex mosaic composed of sea ice with snow, ridges, melt ponds and leads. Because of the resulting spatially heterogeneous light field in the first metres of the water column, it is difficult to measure at single-point locations meaningful \ked{} values that allow predicting average irradiance at any depth. The main objective of this work is to propose a new method to estimate average irradiance over large spatially heterogeneous area as it would be seen by drifting phytoplankton. Using both in situ data and 3D Monte Carlo numerical simulations, we show that (1) the large-area average downward irradiance profile, \meanedz{}, under heterogeneous sea ice cover can be represented by a single-term exponential function and (2) the vertical attenuation coefficient for upward radiance (\klu{}), which is up to two times less influenced by a heterogeneous incident light field than \ked{} in the vicinity of a melt pond, can be used as a proxy to estimate \meanedz{} in the water column.} %DIF >
