\subsection{Comparing in situ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{downward }\DIFaddend irradiance (\ed{}) and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{upward }\DIFaddend radiance (\lu{}) measurements}

An example showing in situ downward irradiance (\ed{}) profiles and upward radiance (\lu{}) profiles at 16 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{different }\DIFdelend visible wavelengths measured under ice is presented in Fig. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3. }\DIFaddend For the \ed{} profiles, subsurface light maxima at \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a depth of }\DIFaddend around 10 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{meters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m }\DIFaddend are clearly visible between 400 and 560 nm.

Furthermore, comparing the different spatial configurations (Fig. 1) showed that the largest error occurred when the melt pond occupied 25\% of the area used to derive the reference average profile (Fig. 9}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m).

\subsection{\DIFadd{Inelastic scattering}}

\DIFadd{Based on in situ data, our results have pointed out that }\klu{} \DIFadd{is not a good proxy for }\ked{} \DIFadd{at longer wavelengths (Supplementary Figs. 3-4) because of the effect of Raman scattering. To validate this hypothesis, we used the HydroLight (Sequoia Scientific, Inc.) radiative transfer numerical model to calculate theoretical downward irradiance and upward radiance and their associated vertical attenuation coefficients in an open water column in the presence of Raman scattering. The simulation was parameterized using IOPs measured during the field campaign (detailed information can be found in the supplementary section entitled Raman inelastic scattering). The simulation was able to reproduce the observed decoupling between }\ked{} \DIFadd{and }\klu{} \DIFadd{observed larger wavelengths $\ge$ 600 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5}\DIFaddend ).
