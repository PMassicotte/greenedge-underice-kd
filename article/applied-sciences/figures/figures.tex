\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig1.pdf}
	\caption{Spatial configurations used for the 3D Monte-Carlo numerical simulations. Percentage covered by the melt pond over the area described by the black lines are also presented. For each of these configuration, light profiles were averaged (see Fig. 6). For visualization, lines of the sampling distances have been plotted only at 10 meters intervals.}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig2.pdf}
	\caption{Examples of downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) light profiles taken under-ice on 2016-06-20. Note the subsurface light maximum for the irradiance profiles that are not present in the radiance profiles.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig3.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) of one light profile taken under-ice. Profiles were normalized to light at 10 meters (under subsurface light maximum) in order to emphasize the similar shape between Ed and Lu.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig4.pdf}
	\caption{Scatter plots showing the relationships between downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) between 400 and 580 nm at different depths (numbers in gray boxes). Blue lines and shaded areas represent respectively the regressions lines and the confidence intervals of the fitted linear models. Dotted lines are the 1:1 lines.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig5.pdf}
	\caption{Cross-sections of simulated irradiance and radiance light profiles going through the 5-meters radius melt pond. For visualization, the number of photons have been normalized between 0 and 1.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig6.pdf}
	\caption{Simulated irradiance and radiance light profiles (black lines, $n$ = 806) along with averaged light profiles (colored lines) from five different configurations with varying proportions of the surface occupied by the melt pond (see Fig. 4). Note that some of the irradiance light profiles show the same subsurface light maxima observed on in-situ data (see Fig. 1).}

	\caption{Reference irradiance profiles (black lines, see Fig. 6) and propagated light using KEd and KLu (see Fig. 7). Propagated light was done using reference irradiance at 0.5 m from the surface.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
