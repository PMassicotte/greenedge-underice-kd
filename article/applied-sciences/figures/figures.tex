\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig1.pdf}
	\caption{Examples of downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) light profiles taken under-ice. Note the subsurface light maximum for the irradiance profiles that are not present in the radiance profiles.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig2.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) of one light profile taken under-ice. Profiles were normalized to light at 10 meters (under subsurface light maximum) in order to emphasize the similar shape between Ed and Lu.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig3.pdf}
	\caption{Scatter plots showing the relationships between downwelling irradiance (Ed) and upwelling radiance (Lu) between 400 and 580 nm. Blue lines and shaded areas represent respectively the regressions lines and the confidence intervals of the fitted linear models. Dotted lines are the 1:1 lines.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig4.pdf}
	\caption{Spatial configurations used for the 3D Monte-Carlo numerical simulations. Numbers in boxes represent the percentage covered by the melt pond over the area described by the black lines (see Fig. 6). For visualization, lines of the sampling distances have been plotted only at 10 meter intervals.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig5.pdf}
	\caption{Cross-sections of simulated irradiance and radiance light profiles going through the 5-meters radius melt pond. For visualization, the number of photons have been normalized between 0 and 1.}

	\caption{Simulated irradiance and radiance light profiles (black lines) along with averaged light profiles (colored lines) from five different configurations with varying proportions of the surface occupied by the melt pond.}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1]{../../../graphs/fig8.pdf}
	\caption{Reference irradiance profiles (black lines, see Fig. 6) and propagated light using KEd and KLu (see Fig. 7). Propagated light was done using reference irradiance at 0.5 mfrom the surface.}
